# yapyap
yapyap is a community-driven anonymous journalling social media app, placing value on the subtlety of online interpersonal connections, where people can be their authentic selves.

This is the winning project of the Community and Connection Track and Best Design Award of nwHacks 2024. I created the AI model to analyze sentiments, and co-developed the frontend.

# Tech Stack
Frontend: React Native, Expo
Backend: Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, MongoDB Atlas
ML Model: Bidirectional RNN made with TensorFlow
